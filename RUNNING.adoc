To get started with Hawkular Services, you'll need to download the latest distribution (or build one), unzip, create
an user and set the Agent to use this password.

You'll also need a Cassandra server up and running. Please, refer to Cassandra's official instructions on how to set
it up.

The following script shows how to accomplish all those steps. Please, don't use this script to setup a production
instance, as it has several flaws (like catching error conditions, insecure password setting, ...).

```
#!/bin/bash

export HAWKULAR_RELEASE="0.0.2.Final"
export HAWKULAR_USERNAME="jdoe"
export HAWKULAR_PASSWORD="password" ## on production systems, you'd want to better protect the password

export HAWKULAR_BASEDIR="/opt/hawkular-services"
export HAWKULAR_HOME="${HAWKULAR_BASEDIR}/hawkular-services-dist-${HAWKULAR_RELEASE}"
export HAWKULAR_DIST="hawkular-services-dist-${HAWKULAR_RELEASE}.zip"
export HAWKULAR_SHASUM="hawkular-services-dist-${HAWKULAR_RELEASE}.zip.sha1"

if [ ! -d "${HAWKULAR_BASEDIR}" ] ; then
  mkdir -p "${HAWKULAR_BASEDIR}"
fi
cd "${HAWKULAR_BASEDIR}"

if [ -f "${HAWKULAR_DIST}" ] ; then
  echo "Using existing distribution"
else
  wget "http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/hawkular/services/hawkular-services-dist/${HAWKULAR_RELEASE}/${HAWKULAR_DIST}"
fi

if [ ! -f "${HAWKULAR_SHASUM}" ] ; then
  wget "https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/org/hawkular/services/hawkular-services-dist/${HAWKULAR_RELEASE}/${HAWKULAR_SHASUM}"
fi

export EXPECTED_SUM=`cat ${HAWKULAR_SHASUM}`
export ACTUAL_SUM=`sha1sum ${HAWKULAR_DIST} | awk '{print $1}'`

if [ "${EXPECTED_SUM}" != "${ACTUAL_SUM}" ] ; then
  echo "Something is wrong. The checksum is not a match. Expected sum: ${EXPECTED_SUM}, actual sum is ${ACTUAL_SUM}"
fi

if [ -d "${HAWKULAR_HOME}" ] ; then
  echo "Existing Hawkular found at ${HAWKULAR_HOME}. Moving it to ${HAWKULAR_HOME}.bkp"
  mv "${HAWKULAR_HOME}" "${HAWKULAR_HOME}.bkp"
fi
unzip -q "hawkular-services-dist-${HAWKULAR_RELEASE}.zip"

cd "${HAWKULAR_HOME}"
echo "Hawkular Home is: ${HAWKULAR_HOME}"
"${HAWKULAR_HOME}/bin/add-user.sh" \
  -a \
  -u "${HAWKULAR_USERNAME}" \
  -p "${HAWKULAR_PASSWORD}" \
  -g read-write,read-only
"${HAWKULAR_HOME}/bin/standalone.sh" -Dhawkular.rest.user="${HAWKULAR_USERNAME}" -Dhawkular.rest.password="${HAWKULAR_PASSWORD} -Dhawkular.agent.enabled=true"
```
